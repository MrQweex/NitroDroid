# NitroDroid: Nitro, on your 'droid

NitroDroid is an app designed to work in conjunction with the desktop application Nitro, also known as Nitro Tasks.

It is released under the zlib license and is available for no cost on the Play store.

NitroDroid is developed independently from Nitro by Jon Petraglia (AKA MrQweex) of Qweex. However, it also tries to do its best to mimic the desktop application as much as possible, with slight tweaks to accommodate a different screen size and input format.
